# Functional and non functional

A library management system is a software application that facilitates the efficient management of library resources, such as books, journals, and multimedia materials, as well as user-related activities like borrowing, returning, and reserving items. Below are examples of functional and non-functional requirements for a library management system:

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - The system must allow users to create accounts and log in with unique credentials.

2. **Search and Cataloging:**
   - Users should be able to search for books, authors, and other materials by title, author, subject, or ISBN.
   - The system should maintain a comprehensive catalog of all library resources, including details like title, author, publication year, and availability status.

3. **Borrowing and Returning:**
   - Users must be able to borrow items from the library and specify the return date.
   - The system should send reminders to users for overdue items.

4. **Reservations:**
   - Users should be able to place reservations on currently unavailable items.
   - When a reserved item becomes available, the system should notify the respective user.

5. **User Roles and Permissions:**
   - Different user roles (e.g., librarian, administrator, student, faculty) with appropriate permissions should be defined.

6. **Administrative Functions:**
   - Librarians and administrators should have access to manage the library catalog, add new items, and remove outdated resources.
   - The system must allow librarians to view borrowing history and manage user accounts.

7. **Reporting and Statistics:**
   - Generate reports for popular books, overdue items, and other relevant statistics.
   - Display real-time status of available and borrowed items.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

1. **Performance:**
   - The system should respond quickly to user interactions and searches, even with a large database.

2. **Reliability:**
   - The system must be reliable and available to users during library operating hours.

3. **Security:**
   - Ensure secure user authentication and data encryption to protect user privacy and sensitive information.
   - Implement access control measures to restrict unauthorized access to administrative functions.

4. **Scalability:**
   - The system should be scalable to handle an increasing number of users and library resources.

5. **Usability:**
   - The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for both library staff and patrons.
   - Provide error handling and informative messages to guide users.

6. **Compatibility:**
   - The system should work across various devices and web browsers.

7. **Maintainability:**
   - The codebase should be well-structured and documented to facilitate future maintenance and updates.

8. **Integration:**
   - The system should be able to integrate with other library-related software, such as RFID systems or online databases.

These requirements form the basis for developing a comprehensive library management system that caters to the needs of both library staff and patrons, providing a seamless and efficient library experience.
